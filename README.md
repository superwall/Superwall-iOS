- Select **File ▸ Add Packages...**
- Search for `https://github.com/superwall/Superwall-iOS` in the search bar.
- Set the **Dependency Rule** to **Up to Next Major Version** with the lower bound set to **4.0.0**.
- Make sure your project name is selected in **Add to Project**.
- Then, **Add Package**.

### Cocoapods

[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) is an alternative dependency manager for iOS projects. For usage and installation instructions, please visit their website.
To include the *Superwall* SDK in your app, add the following to your Podfile:

```
pod 'SuperwallKit', '< 5.0.0'
```

Next, run `pod repo update` to update your local spec repo.

Then, run `pod install` from your terminal.
