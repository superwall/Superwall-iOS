# ``SuperwallKit``

The client SDK for [Superwall](https://superwall.com), a service that lets you remotely configure, present and iterate paywalls – helping you find winners quickly.

## Overview

Superwall makes it easy to show paywalls in your app using UIKit or SwiftUI. If you haven't already, [sign up for a free Superwall account](https://superwall.com/sign-up). Configure the SDK with your API key and present our example paywall in response to a tracked event. When you're ready to use your own paywalls, head to the Superwall dashboard and use the paywall editor to configure them. Then, create a Campaign and define rules to determine when to show paywalls to users.

See our [docs](https://docs.superwall.com/docs) for more information.
