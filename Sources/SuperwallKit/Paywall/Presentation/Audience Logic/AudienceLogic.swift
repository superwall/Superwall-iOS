  /// This first finds a trigger for a given placement name. Then it determines whether any of the
  /// audiences of the triggers match for that placement.
  /// It takes that audience filter and checks the disk for a confirmed variant assignment for the audience's
  /// experiment ID. If there isn't one, it checks the unconfirmed assignments.
  /// Then it returns the result of the placement given the assignment.

  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - placement: The tracked placement
  ///   - triggers: The triggers from config.
  ///   - configManager: A `ConfigManager` object used for dependency injection.
  ///   - storage: A `Storage` object used for dependency injection.
  ///   - isPreemptive: A boolean that indicates whether the rule is being preemptively
  ///   evaluated. Setting this to `true` prevents the rule's occurrence count from being incremented
  ///   in Core Data.
  /// - Returns: An assignment to confirm, if available.
