/// The Objective-C-only protocol that handles Superwall's subscription-related logic.
///
/// By default, the Superwall SDK handles all subscription-related logic. However, if you'd like
/// more control, you can return a ``PurchaseControllerObjc`` when configuring the SDK via
/// ``Superwall/configure(apiKey:purchaseController:options:completion:)-52tke``.
///
/// When implementing this, you also need to set the ``Superwall/subscriptionStatus`` using
/// `Superwall.shared.subscriptionStatus`.
///
/// To learn how to implement the ``PurchaseControllerObjc`` in your app
/// and best practices, see [Purchases and Subscription Status](https://docs.superwall.com/docs/advanced-configuration).

  /// Called when the user initiates purchasing of a product.
  ///
  /// Add your purchase logic here and call the completion block with the result. You can use Apple's StoreKit APIs,
  /// or if you use RevenueCat, you can call [`Purchases.shared.purchase(product:)`](https://revenuecat.github.io/purchases-ios-docs/4.13.4/documentation/revenuecat/purchases/purchase(product:completion:)).
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - product: The `SKProduct` the user would like to purchase.
  ///   - completion: A completion block the accepts a ``PurchaseResult`` object and an optional `Error`.
  ///   Call this with the result of your purchase logic. When you pass a `.failed` result, make sure you also pass
  ///   the error.
  ///    **Note:** Make sure you handle all cases of ``PurchaseResult``.

  /// Called when the user initiates a restore.
  ///
  /// Add your restore logic here, making sure that the user's subscriptionStatus is updated after restore,
  /// then call the completion block.
  /// 
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - completion: A completion block that accepts two objects. 1. A ``RestorationResultObjc`` that's `.restored` if the user's purchases were restored or `.failed` if they weren't. 2. An optional error that you can return when the restore failed.
  /// **Note**: `restored` does not imply the user has an active subscription, it just mean the restore had no errors.
